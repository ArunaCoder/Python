# In Python, in and not in are the membership operators. They are used to test whether a value or variable is found in a sequence (string, list, tuple, set and dictionary).

message = 'Hello world'
dict1 = {1:'a', 2:'b'}

# check if 'H' is present in message string
print('H' in message)  # prints True

# check if 'hello' is present in message string
print('hello' not in message)  # prints True

# check if '1' key is present in dict1
print(1 in dict1)  # prints True

# check if 'a' key is present in dict1
print('a' in dict1)  # prints False
