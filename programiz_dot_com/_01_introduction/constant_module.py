'''
A constant is a special type of variable whose value cannot be changed.

In Python, constants are usually declared and assigned in a module (a new file containing variables, functions, etc which is imported to the main file).

In reality, we don't use constants in Python. Naming them in all capital letters is a convention to separate them from variables, however, it does not actually prevent reassignment.
